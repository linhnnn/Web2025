        <h1>Jackson Electronics Introduces <br/>
            a New Line of Products</h1>
    </center>
    <p>Jackson Electronics announced this month a new line of small business printers, copiers and scanners. Designed to meet the growing need for economical scanning and printing solutions, the new products do not sacrifice quality or dependability.
    </p>
    <p>    The ScanMaster continues Jackson Electronics' leadership in the field of flatbed scanners. With the patented "Single-Pass" technology, the ScanMaster is fast, with image quality better than multiple-pass scanners.
    </p>
    <p>    Building on its popular line of laser printers, Jackson Electronics introduces the LaserPrint 5000. The LaserPrint 5000 prints b&w text at 12 ppm. and its memory expands up to 24 megabytes for graphic-intensive print jobs.
    </p>
    <p>    The new Print/Scan 150 combines the benefits of a printer, copier and scanner - all in one! And all without sacrificing quality. Save money (and space) with this three-in-one product.
